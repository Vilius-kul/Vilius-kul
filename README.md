### Hi there, I'm Vilius 👋
#### I'm an ex-living wall specialist and believe it or not, software development has a lot in common with gardening. 
#### let me use the quote from The Pragmatic Programmer
>Software is more like gardening--it is more organic than concrete.[...] You constantly monitor the health of the garden and make adjustments (to the soil, the plants, the layout) as needed.
